Children have either asymptomatic or mild infection. The general practice is to first evaluate any new vaccine in older population and then age reduction is done to assess the safety and effectiveness in paediatric population. The currently available vaccines have not been evaluated in children so far. There are some clinical trials now underway to test the effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines in children.</p></div><div class="B b12"><h6>What technology has been used in development of the currently available two vaccines in India? <span style="position: absolute; right: 30px; font-size: 22px;" class="bpl12">+</span></h6><p class="bp12 none">Covishield® vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, is a Viral Vector-based Technology which is also used to manufacture Ebola vaccine.<br> Covaxin® vaccine, manufactured by the Bharat Biotech, is a Whole-virion Inactivated Coronavirus Vaccine which is also used to manufacture vaccines like Influenza, Rabies and Hepatitis- A.<br></p></div><div class="B b13"><h6>What is the composition of both the vaccines? <span style="position: absolute; right: 30px; font-size: 22px;" class="bpl13">+</span></h6><p class="bp13 none">Composition of Covishield includes inactivated adenovirus with segments of Coronavirus, Aluminium Hydroxide Gel, L-Histidine, L-Histidine Hydrochloride Monohydrate, Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate, Polysorbate 80, Ethanol, Sucrose, Sodium Chloride, and Disodium Edetate Dihydrate (EDTA).

For them, vaccines are absolutely safe.</p></div><div class="B b26"><h6>The health advisory also states that those with immunity issues should be cautious about taking the vaccine. What are the markers of 'Immunity issues'?<span style="position: absolute; right: 30px; font-size: 22px;" class="bpl26">+</span></h6><p class="bp26 none">Immune issues are of two types: one, immunosuppression due to any disease such as AIDS, and people on immunosuppressant drugs such as anti-cancer drugs, steroids, etc. Second, immunodeficiency in people who suffers from some defect in the body's protective system such as congenital immunodeficiency.<br><br> Currently, available COVID-19 vaccines do not have any live virus and therefore individuals with immune issues can have the vaccine safely. But the vaccine may not be as effective in them. One should inform the vaccinator about the medicines they consume and if they are suffering from any known immune issues. The vaccinator should have a record of one’s medical condition.</p></div></section><section id="SEC4"><h5>HOW WILL WE BE VACCINATED?</h5><div class="B b27"><h6>Out of the multiple vaccines available, how is one or more vaccine chosen for administration?<span style="position: absolute; right: 30px; font-size: 22px;" class="bpl27">+</span></h6><p class="bp27 none">The safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of vaccine candidates are examined by Drug regulator of our country before granting the license for the same.
